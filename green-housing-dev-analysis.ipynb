    "Seattle's population has been growing every year, largely fueled by the world-renown tech sector here, home of many top companies. \n",
    "As the population grows, the price of [rent seems to be growing with it](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/report-seattle-rent-increased-nearly-19-year-over-year/LMUY74T3FRF5FNEWTG2KBKMJQ4/). Dwell Development wants to respond to this demand by creating new, affordable, multi-family housing for the growing population of tech workers in King County. \n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem then breaks into two parts: which houses are available in the same zip codes as local tech companies, to minimize commute, and what features correlate most with price, in order to minimize costs for both Dwell Development and the families on the housing market.\n",
