    "Seattle's population has been growing every year, largely fueled by the world-renown tech sector here, home of many top companies. \n",
    "As the population grows, the price of [rent seems to be growing with it](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/report-seattle-rent-increased-nearly-19-year-over-year/LMUY74T3FRF5FNEWTG2KBKMJQ4/). Dwell Development wants to respond to this demand by creating new, affordable, multi-family housing for the growing population of tech workers in King County. \n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem breaks into three parts: which houses are available in the same zip codes as local tech companies, in order to minimize commute, which features correlate most with price, in order to minimize costs for both Dwell Development and the families on the housing market. With those two criteria met, we then are able to narrow down the selection of properties to find the available properties with the greatest acreage \n"

This was seemingly unavoidable due to the inherantly coupled nature of some aspects of houses, i.e., if more bedrooms are added, it is almost always true that more bathrooms would be too, or more floors and living space to accommodate them. We hope to find any possible workarounds to this limitation going forward.\n",

House prices have fluctuated a lot in the past few years, especially due to the pandemic's effects on the economy. For future analysis, we would like to mine recent and relevant data and explore trends in pricing over time.\n",
